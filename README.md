## Ground Rules & Expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you
should expect from others):

- Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come
  from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different
  perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than
  convince them that your way is correct.
- Open Source Guides are released with a
  [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
  By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
- If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all
  tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can
  merge your contribution.
- When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't
  add references or links to things you or your employer have created as others
  will do so if they appreciate it.

## How to Contribute ?

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the
[issues](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/issues) and
[pull requests](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/pulls) to see whether
someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this
guide, do one of the following:

- **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
- **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide, start by opening an
  issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you
  do any work.
